## 🧩 Page Audit & Critique

**Old content summary:**
The previous page offered comprehensive criminal law psychological assessments with emphasis on fast CVs (24h), Legal Aid compliance, and a wide range of services including fitness to plead, risk assessment, and cognitive evaluations.

**Strengths:**
- Extensive service range (10+ assessment types)
- Legal Aid rate compliance emphasized
- Fast turnaround options
- Quality assurance via proof-reading
- Accessible tone ("Finding an expert witness shouldn't be a trial")

**Weaknesses:**
- Limited detail on individual psychologist specializations (forensic vs clinical)
- No pricing transparency beyond "Legal Aid rates"
- Minimal information on assessment methodology or tools used
- Few case examples specific to criminal contexts
- Missing FAQ section for common criminal law questions
- No empathy for defense vs prosecution context differences

**Improvement focus:**
Restructure with empathetic opening addressing criminal defense pressures, add clear methodology explanations (Pritchard criteria, etc.), include specialist expertise differentiation, add comprehensive FAQ, and provide layered CTAs with trust signals specific to criminal court requirements.

## FAQs

**Q: What is the difference between fitness to plead and fitness to participate?**
A: **Fitness to plead** is the threshold question of whether defendant can engage in trial at all (Pritchard criteria). **Fitness to participate** assumes defendant is fit to plead but asks whether reasonable adjustments are needed for effective participation (e.g., intermediary, frequent breaks). Our psychologists assess both.

**Q: Can your psychologists assess defendants in custody?**
A: Yes. Our experts are experienced in prison-based assessments and hold enhanced DBS clearance. They are familiar with security protocols and can conduct assessments in police custody, remand prisons, or secure hospitals.

**Q: Do you work at Legal Aid rates for criminal cases?**
A: Yes. Our experts accept Legal Aid Agency (LAA) rates for both defense and prosecution work. We can provide transparent fixed-fee quotes within 24 hours of instruction.

**Q: What are typical turnaround times for fitness to plead assessments?**
A: Standard fitness to plead reports are delivered within **3-4 weeks** from instruction. **Fast-track options** are available for urgent cases — we can deliver comprehensive assessments in 7-10 days when required (e.g., approaching custody time limits).

**Q: Are your experts qualified to give evidence in Crown Court?**
A: Yes. All our experts are HCPC-registered, professionally insured, and experienced in giving oral evidence in Crown Court. They understand cross-examination and how to present complex psychological evidence to juries and judges.

**Q: What tools and tests do your psychologists use?**
A: Our experts use validated, evidence-based tools including WAIS-IV (IQ testing), Gudjonsson Suggestibility Scales (suggestibility), HCR-20 (violence risk), comprehensive neuropsychological batteries, and clinical diagnostic interviews. All testing is referenced in reports.
