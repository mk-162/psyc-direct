Solicitors and parole boards need psychiatrists who can:

- **Distinguish mental illness from personality disorder** — crucial for disposal decisions
- **Assess psychiatric risk** of serious harm or reoffending
- **Provide prognosis** for mental health conditions with and without treatment

You need **GMC-registered Forensic Psychiatrists** who understand both medical science and prison law.

## When to Instruct a Psychiatrist vs Psychologist

### Instruct a Psychiatrist When:
- **Diagnosis of mental illness** is in question (psychosis, bipolar, severe depression)
- **Mental Health Act** assessment or hospital transfer recommendation needed
- **Medication and treatment** considerations are central to the case
- **Medical causation** of psychiatric symptoms needs establishing
- **Diminished responsibility** defense requires psychiatric evidence of abnormality of mind
- **Psychiatric risk** of serious harm needs medical assessment
- **Dual diagnosis** (mental illness + substance misuse) requiring medical formulation

### Instruct a Psychologist When:
- **Cognitive assessment** (IQ, neuropsychological testing) needed
- **Learning disability** or autism assessment required
- **Risk assessment** using structured tools (HCR-20, RSVP) is primary focus
- **Personality assessment** not requiring medical diagnosis
- **Psychological therapy** recommendations needed

### Instruct Both When:
- **Complex cases** requiring both diagnostic clarity (psychiatry) and psychological formulation
- **Diminished responsibility** cases benefiting from both medical and psychological evidence
- **Risk assessment** where mental illness and psychological factors both relevant

_Our team can advise on whether psychiatry, psychology, or combined input is most appropriate for your case._

## FAQs

**Q: What is the difference between a psychiatrist and psychologist for prison law cases?**
