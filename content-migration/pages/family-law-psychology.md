## The Challenge

Family law cases involve the most profound decisions — **where children live, who they see, and whether families can stay together**.

Solicitors handling care proceedings and contact disputes face:
- **Emotional complexity** requiring sensitive yet objective assessment
- **26-week statutory timescales** for care proceedings (often shorter in reality)
- **High-stakes outcomes** where report quality directly affects children's futures
- **Contested parenting capacity** requiring robust, defensible expert evidence
- **Allegations of abuse or alienation** demanding specialist forensic skills

You need psychologists who **understand the urgency, maintain objectivity, and deliver reports that withstand cross-examination**.
