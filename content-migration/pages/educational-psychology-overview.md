# Educational Psychology Services for Schools & Local Authorities

<!-- PAGE TYPE: Service - Overview/Pillar -->
<!-- TARGET URL: https://psychologydirect.co.uk/educational-psychologist/ -->

## 🧩 Page Audit & Critique

**Old content summary:**
The previous page offered educational psychology services for schools, MATs, and local authorities with emphasis on EHCP support, fast matching (CVs in 24h), and capacity solutions. It differentiated between school-based and LA-based services.

**Strengths:**
- Clear service differentiation (schools vs LAs)
- Strong LA and MAT testimonials
- Emphasis on statutory timescale management
- Volume discount pricing model
- Dedicated client managers mentioned

**Weaknesses:**
- Limited empathy for SEND pressures and capacity challenges
- Minimal detail on training program specifics
- No discussion of post-assessment support
- Missing specialist expertise areas (autism, dyslexia, etc.)
- Lack of case studies or outcome data
- No FAQ section

**Improvement focus:**
Restructure with empathetic opening addressing SEND capacity crisis, add clear benefits for schools vs LAs, include specialist expertise areas, provide comprehensive FAQ section, and use layered CTAs with trust signals specific to education sector.
