For many school leaders, **[Multi-Academy Trust](https://www.psychologydirect.co.uk/educational-psychologist/schools-academies-colleges/) **(MAT) directors, and SENCOs, the term "Educational Psychologist" (EP) often brings one thing to mind: statutory assessments for an **[Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP)](https://www.psychologydirect.co.uk/resources/education/what-does-an-educational-psychology-report-cover/)**.

While providing expert psychological advice for EHCPs remains a crucial statutory duty, the modern role of an Educational Psychology (EP) service has evolved far beyond this single function.

To view an EP service solely through the lens of assessment is to miss its greatest potential. Today, a true partnership with an [ ](http://www.psychologydirect.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Children-running-in-the-playground.png)EP service is about building your school or Trust’s capacity from within. It’s about moving from a reactive, case-by-case model to a proactive, strategic approach that supports staff, improves whole-school outcomes, and creates an environment where every child can thrive.

This article explores what a modern EP service truly does and why a strategic partnership is one of the most powerful investments a school or Trust can make.

## **What is an Educational Psychology Service?**

At its core, an Educational Psychology Service applies psychological principles to the learning and development of children and young people aged 0-25. It is a service dedicated to understanding how children think, feel, learn, and behave, and using that understanding to overcome barriers to their success.

An EP in education is a highly trained professional with expertise in both psychology and education. They are scientist-practitioners who work at multiple levels, with individual children, with groups, with teaching staff, and with senior leaders to facilitate positive change.

## **Why Might a Child Be Referred to an Educational Psychologist?**

A referral is typically made by a school when their own cycles of support (often called Assess, Plan, Do, Review) have not led to the expected progress. The reasons are broad and can include concerns about a child's:

- **Learning and Cognition:** General learning difficulties, specific challenges with literacy or numeracy, or concerns about underlying conditions.
- **Social, Emotional, and Mental Health (SEMH):** Anxiety, low mood, challenging behaviour, difficulties with relationships, or the impact of trauma.
- **Communication and Interaction:** Difficulties understanding social cues or expressing themselves.
- **Physical and Sensory Needs:** The psychological impact of physical or sensory difficulties on learning and wellbeing.

The EP's first step isn't to test, but to listen and understand the concerns of the school, the parents, and the child themselves.

## **What Will an Educational Psychologist *****Actually***** Do?**

While a formal assessment might be one outcome, the modern EP's toolkit is far broader and more consultative. Their work is often focused on early intervention and prevention, aiming to build skills and confidence in the adults who know the child best.

A partnership with an EP service like Psychology Direct can include:

- **Consultation:** This is the cornerstone of modern practice. An EP will facilitate structured, solution-focused conversations with teachers, SENCOs, and parents to unpick complex situations, generate new ideas, and agree on practical, evidence-based strategies to try in the classroom and at home.

- **Training and Capacity Building:** EPs can deliver professional development for your staff on a huge range of topics. This empowers your team with the psychological knowledge they need to support pupils more effectively every day.

- **Systemic and Strategic Work:** We partner with school and Trust leaders to help shape whole-school policies and strategies. This could involve developing a new behaviour policy rooted in relational practice, building a whole-school approach to mental wellbeing, or helping to improve your SEND provision ahead of an Ofsted inspection.

- **Intervention:** EPs can design and deliver targeted group or individual interventions focusing on areas like managing anxiety, developing social skills, or improving emotional literacy.

- **Psychological Assessment:** When required, an EP will conduct a comprehensive psychological assessment. This is not just about identifying a 'problem' in the child, but about understanding that child’s unique profile of strengths and needs within their environment. The goal is always to provide recommendations that unlock their potential.

## **The Psychology Direct Partnership: A Managed, Expert-Led Service**

Engaging an Educational Psychology service shouldn't create more administrative work for you. At Psychology Direct, we provide a fully managed service designed for efficiency and quality.

This means:

- You'll work with a dedicated support team. Your EP manages direct school arrangements, while our Education Coordinators handle all vital support: tracking forms, proofreading reports and consultation notes. This streamlined process ensures everyone can focus on student outcomes.
- Before our EP begins their work, our central team reviews all referral documents to ensure everything is in place. This simple step prevents delays and eliminates the frustrating back-and-forth that can occur with independent contractors.
- Our Educational Psychologists aren't working in isolation. They are part of a collaborative team with access to regular training, peer supervision, and the collective expertise of our entire team. This ensures the advice you receive is not just one individual's opinion, but is reflective of current, robust best practice.

A modern Educational Psychology service doesn't just provide answers; it builds the capacity for you to find them. It is a collaborative partnership designed to empower your staff, support your students, and help everybody achieve their goals.
