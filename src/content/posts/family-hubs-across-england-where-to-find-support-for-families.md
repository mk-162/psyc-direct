The government has provided funding to 88 local authorities across [**England to establish family hubs**](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-family-hub-sites). As of March 2025, there are now over 640 family hub sites operating across England, providing accessible support for families from pregnancy through to when children reach 19 (or up to 25 for young people with special educational needs and disabilities).

But where exactly are these hubs, and what does this growing network mean for families and professionals working in education?

## **Finding Your Local Family Hub**

To help families and professionals easily locate their nearest family hub, we've created an interactive map showing all sites across England, current as of 1st October 2025.

It's worth noting that this data is according to management information provided by local authorities to the government and may not be a comprehensive list of all family hubs operating. Some local authorities may have additional family hub sites beyond those listed in the government's funded programmes.

## **What Are Family Hubs?**

Family hubs provide a single place to go for support and information from a variety of services. Rather than families navigating multiple services across different locations, family hubs bring support together under one roof (or through a connected network of services).

Support available includes, but is not limited to

- Infant feeding advice
- Parenting classes and workshops
- Perinatal mental health
- Family therapy
- Assistance with home learning and early language development.

This coordinated approach means families can access help earlier, before challenges escalate into crises.

If you are looking for support through a family hub, you will be able to see the full range of support offered on each hub’s website or that of the local authority the hub is under.

## **The Two Funding Programmes**

The 88 funded local authorities are supported through two distinct programmes:

### **Family Hubs and Start for Life Programme**

Seventy-five local authorities have received joint funding from the Department for Education (DfE) and the Department for Health and Social Care. As of March 2025, there were 551 family hubs in these local authorities.

### **Family Hubs Transformation Fund**

A further 13 local authorities have received support through the DfE Family Hubs Transformation Fund. As of March 2025, there were 90 family hubs in these local authorities.
