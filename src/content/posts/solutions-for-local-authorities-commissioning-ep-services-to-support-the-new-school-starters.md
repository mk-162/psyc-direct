Local Authorities (LAs) and Multi-Academy Trusts (MATs) face unprecedented pressure in managing Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) provision. This challenge is further compounded by the unique needs of the children who spent their formative years in lockdown and are now entering the school system with distinct developmental profiles.

We are seeing record numbers of children needing specialist support, from **[soaring anxiety levels](https://www.centreforyounglives.org.uk/news-centre/future-minds-campaign-launches-with-new-research-warning-the-trillion-pound-cost-of-failing-to-tackle-the-childrens-and-young-peoples-mental-health-crisis-is-holding-back-governments-growth-plans)** to **[significant delays in speech and language](https://speechandlanguage.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Support-not-sanctions-Making-school-fair-for-2-million-children-FINAL.pdf)**. This demand is exacerbating existing pressures, with persistent absence rates showing concerning increases across primary schools, and significant attainment gaps for children facing poverty continuing to widen.

Our own research with young people reveals the complexity of these challenges, with students telling us about the stress and pressure they experience:
***"School too much pressure and lack of support"
*
*****"I have been given a lot of stress and pressure because of these things plus they are high expectations that I barely manage to meet."***

This widespread need, alongside overwhelmed SENCOs and a persistent lack of funding and staff, necessitates not just operational adjustments but a strategic commissioning approach that addresses current pressures while building long-term capacity.

This guide explores the specific pressures LAs and MATs are facing and how strategic commissioning of **[Educational Psychology (EP)](https://www.psychologydirect.co.uk/educational-psychologist/)** services can provide critical solutions.

## **The Pressures on Local Authorities and MATs**

- A noticeable **[rise in referrals for EHCP assessments](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/special-educational-needs-in-england/2024-25)** and specialist interventions due to widespread developmental concerns. This contributes to the already overwhelmed capacity of existing in-house teams.
- Managing escalating high-needs budgets amidst rising demand and the cost of statutory assessments, often without a corresponding increase in central government funding. The "postcode lottery" effect in SEND provision, **[cited in reports by organisations like the National Audit Office](https://www.nao.org.uk/reports/support-for-pupils-with-special-educational-needs-and-disabilities/)**, is a direct result of these resource disparities and highlighted in various reports on SEND funding
- The national shortage of EPs and other SEND professionals makes it difficult to meet statutory duties and provide timely support, leading to backlogs. This lack of staff is a critical barrier to effective provision, contributing to the pressure on in-house LA teams and exacerbating persistent absence.
- Delays in [**assessment**, **insufficient provision**](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5901/cmselect/cmpubacc/353/report.html), or lack of early intervention/support, often caused by stretched resources, can increase the risk of costly and resource-intensive SEND tribunal appeals.

## **The Evolving Needs of the New School Starters**

Research from the **[Education Endowment Foundation](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/projects-and-evaluation/projects/the-impact-of-the-covid-19-pandemic-on-childrens-socioemotional-well-being-and-attainment-during-the-reception-year)** and studies on pandemic impact highlight several key areas

- Communication delays requiring more intensive speech and language support
- Social and emotional vulnerabilities, exhibiting higher rates of separation anxiety, challenges with peer interaction, and difficulties regulating emotions in group settings. The spike in anxiety is a major concern, as noted by professionals across the educational landscape, and can contribute to persistent absence.
- School readiness gaps, a lack of some foundational skills for independent learning within a structured environment, leading to increased pressure on Reception and Key Stage 1 teachers.

These widespread needs necessitate a systemic response, requiring LAs and MATs to think beyond individual case management.

## **Commissioning for Impact: The Strategic EP Partnership**

A truly effective EP service partnership can offer LAs and MATs much more than just a means to clear an EHCP backlog. It can be a strategic asset for system-wide improvement and sustainability, helping to counteract the "postcode lottery" effect and alleviate pressure on in-house teams.

### Consider commissioning an EP service that provides:

- Capacity Building & Sufficiency Solutions:

 	An external EP partner can provide surge capacity for statutory assessments, reducing waiting lists and ensuring compliance, especially when your own teams are understaffed
- This frees up your in-house EP teams to focus on early intervention, preventative work, and complex cases, optimising your existing workforce and directly addressing the problem of persistent absence and the attainment gap

- Strategic Insight & Systemic Support:

 	EPs can conduct systemic reviews of SEND provision across schools, provide data analysis to identify trends, and advise on developing comprehensive SEND strategies for the entire LA or MAT. This can help meet the **[government's 2028 target for early years development.](https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/ready-to-learn-increasing-the-number-of-five-year-olds-with-a-good-level-of-development/#:~:text=We%20will%20measure%20our%20progress,development%2C%20and%20maths%20and%20literacy.)**

- Targeted Staff Professional Development:

 	Understanding where staff knowledge and confidence sits in relation to supporting newer cohorts is essential. This begins with conducting training needs analyses to identify specific areas where professional development is required. Based on these insights, targeted training can be delivered on topics such as trauma-informed practice, language development strategies, and anxiety management.
- This upskills the frontline workforce, reducing reliance on individual specialist referrals in the long run and fostering more inclusive environments, particularly vital when SENCOs are overwhelmed.

- Risk Mitigation & Quality Assurance:

 	FA partner with robust quality assurance processes can ensure all assessments and reports are legally defensible and meet the highest standards, helping to reduce tribunal risk and ensure equitable provision despite funding challenges.
