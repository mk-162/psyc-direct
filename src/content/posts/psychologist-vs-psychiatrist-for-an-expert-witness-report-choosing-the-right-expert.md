## **What is a Psychologist?**

A psychologist typically holds a doctorate-level qualification (e.g., PhD, DPsych, PsyD) in psychology.

- **Training:** Extensive academic and clinical training in psychological assessment, diagnosis (using diagnostic frameworks where appropriate, but focusing on psychological formulation), and various therapeutic interventions.

- **Prescribing Medication:** Psychologists in the UK do not prescribe medication.

- Mental capacity is a central issue, particularly within the framework of the Mental Capacity Act 2005.
