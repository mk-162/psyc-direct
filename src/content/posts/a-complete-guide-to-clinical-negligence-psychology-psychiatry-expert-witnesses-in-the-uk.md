Clinical negligence cases involving psychological harm present unique challenges. Unlike physical injuries, psychological injuries require specialised assessment to establish causation, severity, and long-term impact within UK medical law.

Understanding when to engage a psychiatrist versus a psychologist can make the difference between a successful outcome and a costly defeat.

## **Choosing the Right Expert for Clinical Negligence Cases. Psychology vs Psychiatry.**

The choice between psychology and psychiatry experts is critical. While both provide valuable evidence, they serve different purposes in clinical negligence claims.

### **When You Need a Psychiatry Expert Witness**

Psychiatrists are medical doctors who provide essential expertise when you need:

- **Medical diagnosis and causation** - Formal psychiatric conditions like major depression, PTSD, or psychotic episodes following medical negligence
- **Medication-related claims** - Psychiatric medication errors, inappropriate prescribing, or dangerous drug interactions
- **Severe psychiatric conditions** - Complex cases requiring hospitalisation or involving treatment-resistant conditions
- **Treatment standard assessment** - Opinions on psychiatric practice standards and medication management
- **Suicide risk cases** - Failure to assess suicide risk or inadequate monitoring of suicidal patients

### **When You Need a Psychology Experts Witness**

Psychologists excel at functional assessment and psychological testing, particularly for:

- **Comprehensive testing** - Neuropsychological assessment to measure cognitive impairment or memory problems
- **Functional impact evaluation** - How psychological injuries affect daily life, work capacity, and relationships
- \**Trauma assessment **- Detailed evaluation of PTSD symptoms, triggers, and functional impact
- **Cognitive effects** - Memory problems after anaesthetic complications or concentration difficulties
- **Treatment planning** - Recommendations for psychological rehabilitation and long-term support

## **Understanding Clinical Negligence Requirements**

### **What Constitutes Clinical Negligence?**

Under UK law, clinical negligence occurs when a healthcare professional fails to provide the standard of care that a reasonably competent professional would provide under similar circumstances, resulting in harm to the patient. For psychological harm claims, this involves establishing that:

- The healthcare professional owed a duty of care to the patient
- The professional breached that duty of care
- The breach directly caused psychological harm
- The harm resulted in quantifiable damages

### **When Mental Health Experts Are Essential**

[**Psychology**](https://www.psychologydirect.co.uk/) and [**Psychiatry**](https://www.psychiatrydirect.co.uk/) expert witnesses become crucial in clinical negligence cases when:

Cases where the negligent medical treatment directly caused psychiatric conditions such as PTSD, depression, anxiety disorders, or more severe conditions requiring psychiatric intervention.

Situations where physical medical negligence resulted in consequential psychological injury, such as depression following surgical complications, anxiety arising from misdiagnosis, or PTSD from traumatic medical experiences.

Claims involving inappropriate psychiatric medication, inadequate supervision of suicidal patients, failure to provide necessary mental health interventions, or substandard psychiatric care standards.

Cases involving missed or delayed diagnosis of psychological or psychiatric conditions, incorrect psychiatric treatment, or inadequate mental health care provided by medical professionals.

Claims involving psychiatric side effects from medical drugs, failure to warn of psychological risks, or drug interactions causing mental health complications.

## **Mental Health Assessment in Clinical Negligence Cases**

### **Legal Framework**

Clinical negligence occurs when healthcare professionals fail to provide reasonable care, resulting in harm. For psychological claims, you must establish:

- Duty of care owed to the patient
- Breach of that duty
- Direct causation of psychological harm
- Quantifiable damages

### **Assessment Requirements**

A comprehensive mental health assessment includes:

- **Clinical evaluation** - Psychiatric state before, during, and after alleged negligence
- **Medical record review** - GP notes, hospital records, and previous mental health assessments
- **Psychometric testing** - Standardised tests measuring symptoms and functional impairment
- **Functional impact analysis** - Effects on daily life, work, and relationships
- **Treatment history** - Response to interventions and prognosis for recovery
- **Differential diagnosis** - Ruling out alternative explanations for symptoms

## **Recognised Psychiatric Conditions**

UK courts require evidence of "recognised psychiatric illness" rather than emotional distress. Commonly accepted conditions include:

- Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
- Major Depressive Disorder
- Anxiety Disorders
- Adjustment Disorders
- Medical treatment phobias
- [\**Somatic Symptom Disorders **](https://patient.info/doctor/mental-health/somatic-symptom-disorder)from medical trauma

## **Working Effectively with Expert Witnesses**

### **Essential Instructions**

Provide experts with:

- Detailed chronology of medical events
- Complete medical and psychiatric records
- Clear questions on causation, diagnosis, and prognosis
- Specific legal issues requiring address
- Realistic timelines for completion

### **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

- **Late instruction** - Compromises assessment quality and memory recall
- **Incomplete records** - Missing documentation impacts expert conclusions
- **Wrong expert selection** - Choosing psychology for medical diagnosis needs, or psychiatry for detailed functional assessment
- **Leading questions** - Instructions should remain neutral
- **Unrealistic timescales** - Complex assessments need adequate time

## **Current Developments**

Emerging areas include:

- **Long COVID mental health** - Failure to diagnose psychological aspects
- **Telemedicine negligence** - Inadequate remote assessment or treatment
- **Digital health records** - Negligent handling of mental health information

Success in clinical negligence cases involving psychological harm depends on selecting the right expert early. Psychiatrists provide medical authority for diagnosis and treatment standards, while psychologists offer detailed functional assessment and objective testing.

The choice between disciplines, or using both, can significantly impact case outcomes. Understanding when each type of expertise is needed ensures the strongest possible evidence for your client.
