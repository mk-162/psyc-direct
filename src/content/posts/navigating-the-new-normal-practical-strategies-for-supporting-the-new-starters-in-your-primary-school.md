Primary schools across the UK, especially those welcoming their newest Reception classes, are on the frontline of a significant national challenge. Children who spent their formative years during the COVID-19 lockdowns are presenting with unique developmental needs, a trend increasingly highlighted in national discourse.

These children are contributing to record numbers needing **[specialist support](https://www.psychologydirect.co.uk/educational-psychologist/)**, with observations of **[soaring anxiety levels](https://www.centreforyounglives.org.uk/news-centre/future-minds-campaign-launches-with-new-research-warning-the-trillion-pound-cost-of-failing-to-tackle-the-childrens-and-young-peoples-mental-health-crisis-is-holding-back-governments-growth-plans)** and **[significant delays in speech and language development](https://speechandlanguage.org.uk/the-issue/our-campaigns/support-not-sanctions-making-school-fair-for-2-million-children/).**

COVID-19-related disruption has negatively impacted the attainment of all pupils, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds.[ **Evidence consistently shows**](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/guidance-for-teachers/covid-19-resources/best-evidence-on-impact-of-covid-19-on-pupil-attainment) that the attainment gap between disadvantaged students and their classmates has grown since the onset of the pandemic. Younger year groups (Key Stage 1 pupils) in primary schools have been among the most significantly affected, with lower attainment than previous cohorts across all subjects. This urgent situation calls for adaptability and innovation within our schools.

This guide explores the typical developmental shifts seen in this cohort and provides practical, whole-school strategies to help your pupils thrive.

## **Understanding the Developmental Shifts Post-COVID**

Common areas of impact include:

Speech and language development is a particularly pronounced concern. **[Professor Catherine Davies](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g0rxz2yj4o)** from the University of Leeds notes that some children missed out on "fundamental skills" in the early years. Teaching Assistant Sarah Barraclough from Queen's Drive Primary School in Preston highlights the "huge" impact of Covid, observing that children with delayed speech struggle to "say and understand more words," leading to isolation and difficulty getting involved in playground games.

Limited opportunities for unstructured play with peers outside the family unit have impacted crucial social skills like sharing, turn-taking, and conflict resolution. A spike in anxiety, particularly separation anxiety upon starting school, is frequently observed, alongside challenges in forming and maintaining friendships. Aside from the impact on attainment,**[ teachers have frequently reported concerns](https://d2tic4wvo1iusb.cloudfront.net/production/documents/guidance-for-teachers/covid-19/Impact_of_Covid_on_Learning.pdf?v=1752589467)** around the effect on pupil wellbeing, with emerging evidence suggesting the pandemic has negatively impacted children’s mental health.

Fewer opportunities for activities like dressing independently, managing personal belongings, or navigating group dynamics might affect their ability to adapt to school routines and manage their own learning.

Extended periods in less structured home environments may contribute to challenges with sustained attention and following multi-step instructions in a classroom setting.

## **Whole-School Strategies for Engagement & Wellbeing**

Addressing these needs effectively requires a proactive, whole-school approach that builds on strengths and provides targeted support:

- 

### Prioritise Play-Based Learning and Social Skills

 	Integrate explicit teaching of social skills (sharing, waiting, turn-taking) through play. Structured role-play scenarios can help children navigate social situations they may have missed.

- 

### Cultivate a Language-Rich Environment

 	Create abundant opportunities for conversation, storytelling, and active listening. Model rich vocabulary and encourage children to express themselves fully.

- 

### Support Emotional Regulation and Manage Anxiety

 	Implement consistent routines and clear expectations to build a sense of security. Introduce "calm down" corners or sensory areas where children can self-regulate.

- 

### Empower Staff Through Professional Development

 	Teachers and teaching assistants are on the front lines. Equip them with the knowledge and practical tools to understand the unique needs of this cohort.

## **Leveraging Evidence-Based Resources: The EEF Early Years Toolkit**

To further support your school's efforts, a valuable resource is the [**Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) Early Years Toolkit**](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/early-years/toolkit). This comprehensive, evidence-based toolkit summarises effective approaches for learning and development in early years settings. It's particularly relevant now, as it offers strategies to bolster crucial areas like communication and language approaches, early literacy, self-regulation, and social and emotional learning - precisely the areas where the new school starters often require additional support.

The EEF Toolkit provides clear insights into the estimated impact, cost, and evidence strength of various approaches, empowering school leaders to make informed decisions about implementing strategies that have a proven positive effect on children aged two to seven years old. 

## **When to Seek Specialist Educational Psychology Support**

While whole-school strategies are vital, some children will benefit from more targeted, individualised support. If a child continues to present with significant difficulties despite sustained, evidence-based school interventions, a referral to an Educational Psychologist may be the next step.

An **[Educational Psychologist](https://www.psychologydirect.co.uk/educational-psychologist/schools-academies-colleges/)** (EP) can provide in-depth understanding through assessment and consultation, offering precise recommendations tailored to the child's unique profile, ensuring the right support is put in place. Given the record numbers of children needing specialist support and the widening attainment gap, accessing timely, high-quality EP expertise is more critical than ever.

## **The Psychology Direct Partnership A Managed, Expert-Led Service**

Engaging an **[Educational Psychology service](https://www.psychologydirect.co.uk/educational-psychologist/)** shouldn't create more administrative work for you. At **[Psychology Direct](https://www.psychologydirect.co.uk/)**, we provide a fully managed service designed for efficiency and quality, enabling you to focus on your students.

They are part of a collaborative team with access to regular training, peer supervision, and the collective expertise of our entire clinical team. This ensures the advice you receive is not just one individual's opinion, but is reflective of current, robust best practice.
